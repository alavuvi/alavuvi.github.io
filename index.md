## Introduction
My name is Ville-Pekka Alavuotunki and I'm second year ICT Engineering student in Oulu University of applied sciences. 
I'm passionate about technology and building things, be it a software or a house. Maybe I can combine these two in the future?

## About Me
I have a background in Construction and facility industries and have held various roles, including worker, manager or specialist. My customers and co-workers have said that I'm very productive and on the other hand meticulous and precise at my work who always gives customers the best service possible.  

I've always been passionate about new technology so I decided to pursue a new career in software development. I'm particularly interested in building web sites or applications. In my free time, I enjoy running, gaming or music, and I'm always eager to learn new things.
